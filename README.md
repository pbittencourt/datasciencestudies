# Data Science Studies
My personal studies on **Python** and **R** for *Data Science*, with some variety of resources:

1. **Python 3** course, given by *Gustavo Guanabara* in his Youtube channel, [Curso em VÃ­deo](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrWvhVmt0Qac3HgsjQK62FQ)
1. **Data Science in Python** course, given by [Dataquest](https://app.dataquest.io/path/data-scientist)
1. **Data Analysis in R** course, given by [Dataquest](https://app.dataquest.io/path/data-analyst-r)
1. **Freecodecamp** courses, via [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org):
    * [Scientific Computing With Python Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python), by [Dr. Charles R. Severance](http://www.dr-chuck.com)
1. **edx** courses, via [edx](https://learning.edx.org):
    * [Data Science: R Basics](https://www.edx.org/course/data-science-r-basics), by [Dr. Rafael Irizarry](https://www.edx.org/bio/rafael-irizarry)

Progressively, I'm trying to develop some personal projects. Currently, we have:
1. **Boletim estudantil**, in which we used Python and Google Spreadsheets to generate individual students reports for the school I work for. You can check the [notebook](self/Boletins.ipynb) detailing the whole process.

In this repository, you will find:

* Python and Rcodes with examples
* Notes and assessments
* Guided Projects, written in Jupyter Notebook
