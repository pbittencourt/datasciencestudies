# Python for Data Science
My personal studies on Python for Data Science, with some variety of resources:

2. **Data Science** course, given by [Dataquest](https://app.dataquest.io)
3. **Data Science with Python** course, given by [UCSanDiegoX](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:UCSanDiegoX+DSE200x+1T2020/course/)

In this repository, you will find:

* Python codes with examples
