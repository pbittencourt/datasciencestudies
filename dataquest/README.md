# Data Scientist In Python

My Python studies with [Dataquest](https://app.dataquest.io). In this repository, you will find:

* Python codes with examples
* Guided Projects, written in Jupyter Notebook

## Guided Projects

They're the core of this project. See them in action:

1. [Profitable Apps Profile](https://github.com/pbittencourt/dataquest/blob/master/01-python_for_data_science_fundamentals/Guided_Project_01.ipynb): analyzing *App Store* and *Google Play* datasets to find profitable new app profiles.
2. [Exploring Hacker News Posts](https://github.com/pbittencourt/dataquest/blob/master/02-python_for_data_science_intermediate/Guided_Project_02.ipynb): comparing **[Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/)** 'Ask HN' and 'Show HN' posts to determine which post gets the most comments, on average, and when is the best time of day to create content.
